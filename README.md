# carbfix.dat
The carbfix.dat thermodynamic database for the [PHREEQC](https://wwwbrr.cr.usgs.gov/projects/GWC_coupled/phreeqc/) geochemical modelling software.

For a version including kinetic data, please see [here](https://github.com/CarbFix/carbfix.dat/tree/kinetics).

This database is built upon the [core10.dat](https://github.com/MarcNeveu/IcyDwarf/) database, which is in turn based on the llnl.dat database shipped with PHREEQC.

Current features of carbfix.dat include:
* All the data of core10.dat - thermodynamic data for a vast number of minerals and aqueous species
* 18 zeolite group minerals
* Re-calibrated solubilities of siderite and dolomite
* New data for stabilities of aqueous metal-carbonate complexes
* Data for stabilities of aqueous iron-hydroxide complexes
* Additional data for stabilities of various other aqueous species
* Some bugfixes
